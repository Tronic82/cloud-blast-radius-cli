# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Blast Radius!

## Why do we have a CLA?

To clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, we require that each Contributor sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This protects both you and the project:

- It ensures you have the right to contribute what you're submitting.
- It grants us the necessary rights to use and redistribute your contribution.
- **You retain your copyright**. You are simply giving us permission to use it.

## How to Sign

We use [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) to handle our CLAs.

1. **Open a Pull Request**: When you open a PR, a bot will automatically comment if you haven't signed the CLA.
2. **Follow the Link**: Click the link provided by the bot.
3. **Sign with GitHub**: Authenticate with your GitHub account to sign the agreement.
4. **Rescan**: Once signed, the PR check will automatically pass.

## The Agreement

By signing, you agree that your contributions are your own original work and that you grant the Blast Radius project a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, display, and distribute your contribution.

For the full legal text, please please refer to the agreement presented by the CLA Assistant.
